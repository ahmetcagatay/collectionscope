A second scene shows a bird (heron?) crouched on a nest, in or near a pool or swamp of triangular shape, in which delicate plants and smaller herons are visible. From the air a bird swoops toward this pool. A third scene is not easily decipherable, a barred triangle shape, from which rise dotted oblongs, a long stem, ending in a lotus fruit, but looking more like a lantern on a pole. These different scenes are divided by blocks of little birds and flower clusters.  Although the design is crowded, the several elements have considerable delicacy. Japanese influence is apparent, particularly in the drawing of the trees and birds.\nThe border consists of a series of large flower heads, one a lotus, and big notched green leaves; reserved decoration in the flowers enriches the design. The bottom edge has a narrow outer border of carnations, artichokes and serrated leaves on a white ground.  \n\n"}, {"label": "Era", "value": "1700s"}, {"label": "Place of origin", "value": "India"}, {"label": "Object Type", "value": "Palampore"}, {"label": "Physical description", "value": "Medium: cotton Technique: mordant painted and resist-dyed (chintz) on plain weave"}, {"label": "Dimensions", "value": "H x W: 289.6 x 137.2 cm (114 x 54 in.)
