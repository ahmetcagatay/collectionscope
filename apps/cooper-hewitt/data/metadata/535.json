Its roof rises to a very narrow steeple and is adorned on all sides by very finely worked crockets.  The other belfry at right is also Gothic in style but much more simple, rising from a short octagonal tower and encircled by a gallery.  It has a paneled roof that rises to a narrow steeple with small ball finial at top."}, {"label": "Topic", "value": "Architecture"}, {"label": "Era", "value": "1880s"}, {"label": "City of origin", "value": "Basel"}, {"label": "Place of origin", "value": "Basel"}, {"label": "Creator name", "value": "Warren, Whitney"}, {"label": "Object Type", "value": "Albums"}, {"label": "Physical description", "value": "Graphite on cream paperboard tipped into binding with fabric"}, {"label": "Dimensions", "value": "32.1 x 25 cm (12 5/8 x 9 13/16 in.), irregular"}, {"label": "Provenance", "value": "None"}, {"label": "Credit line", "value": "Gift of Mrs. William Greenough"}, {"label": "Notes", "value": "Research in Progress"}], [{"isTitle": true, "value": "Architectural Details, B\u00e2le"}, {"label": "View item details", "isLink": true, "value": "https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/18569707/"}, {"isImage": true, "value": "https://images.collection.cooperhewitt.org/37583_3ea3d949ef70efeb_z.jpg"}, {"label": "Description", "value": "Vertical sheet with five sketches of architectural details.
